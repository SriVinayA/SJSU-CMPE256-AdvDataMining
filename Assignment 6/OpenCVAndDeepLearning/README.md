# OpenCV and Deep Learning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on image data mining using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. The repository contains a Jupyter notebook, a set of images for analysis or testing, and a detailed document explaining the methodologies and results.

## Contents

- `ImageDataMining_OpenCVAndDeepLearning.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations for the image data mining process using OpenCV and deep learning methods.
- `images/`: A directory containing the images used in the project. These images are likely used for training, testing, or demonstration purposes in the notebook.
- `Vinay - OpenCVandDeepLearning.docx`: A Word document that contains observations and image histograms.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine. You will need Jupyter to run the notebook. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including OpenCV and any deep learning frameworks used in the notebook.
