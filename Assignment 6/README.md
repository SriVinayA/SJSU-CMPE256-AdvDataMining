# Wedding Gown Vector Space Model (VSM) Project

## Overview
This project involves the development of a Vector Space Model (VSM) for a collection of documents related to wedding planning, particularly focusing on items like wedding gowns, roses, diamonds, and flowers. The VSM represents each document as a vector in a space defined by the frequency of certain keywords.

## Project Description
The main objective of this project is to create a VSM that can be used for various natural language processing applications, such as document similarity analysis or information retrieval. The documents are processed to count the frequency of a predefined set of keywords: "Gown," "Rose," "Diamond," and "Flowers."

### Documents Analyzed
The documents (referred to as `d1`, `d2`, `d3`, `d4`) in this project are:

- **d1:** User selected Wedding gown.
- **d2:** User ordered on-line rose flowers.
- **d3:** User searched diamond ring.
- **d4:** User selected white wedding gown, online flowers, 3 carat diamond ring.

### Vocabulary
The vocabulary used for creating the VSM consists of the following words:
- Gown
- Rose
- Diamond
- Flowers

## Methodology
1. **Preprocessing:** The text data from each document is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
2. **Vector Creation:** A vector is created for each document, representing the frequency of each vocabulary word within that document.

## Usage
The Vector Space Model created in this project can be used for:
- Analyzing the similarity between various wedding-related documents.
- Retrieving information based on keyword relevance in the context of wedding planning.

## Tools and Languages
- Python
- Libraries: [List any specific libraries or tools used]
