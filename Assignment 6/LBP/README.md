# Local Binary Patterns (LBP) Image Data Mining

## Overview
This project utilizes Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for image data mining, exploring texture analysis and pattern recognition. The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that details the implementation of LBP and an image dataset for analysis.

## Contents

- `Image_Data_Mining_LBP.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that explains and demonstrates the use of Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for image data mining. The notebook likely includes code snippets, explanations, and visualizations.
- `images/`: A directory containing a collection of images. These images are used within the Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the LBP technique in image analysis.

## Usage

To use this repository, download or clone it to your local environment. Open the Jupyter notebook to view the implementation details and examples. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed for running the notebook.
