# CMPE 256 Class Presentation - VAR Commodity Pricing Model - Gold & Silver

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook showcasing the application of Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) Model in forecasting commodity prices, specifically Gold and Silver. The study is based on the topics covered in the book "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Agricultural Economics: Prognostic Data Analytics to Serve Small-Scale Farmers Worldwide".
